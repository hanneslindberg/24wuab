            See their morals, their code. It's a bad joke. Dropped at the first
            sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to
            be. I'll show you. When the ships are down, these uh, civilized
            people? They'll eat each other.

            I thought by eliminatinf half of life, the other half would thrive.
            But you've shown me, that's inpossible. And as long as there are
            those that remember what was, there will always be those that are
            unable to accept what cen be.

            You knew I was the dragon warrior, you always knew. But when Ogway
            said otherwise, what did you do? Nothing! Who filled my head with
            dreams? Who drove me to train until my bones cracked? Who denied me
            my destiny?

            We're not here because we're free. We're here because we're not
            free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose because as we
            both know without purpose, we would not exist. It is purpose that
            created us, purpose that connects us, purpose that pulls us, that
            guieds us, that drives us, it is purpose that defines us, purpose
            that binds us.
